    #Compiles code written in an assembly-like language into chemfuck for spacestation13 goonstation

    ##Version 1: No input code and only simple for-loop, no while-loop or true for, this allows variables to be completely hidden
    
    #Notes: 
    #	Number inputs are indicated with # followed by a number. So in code you should replace #s with just the number of the source 
    #	The code ignroes letter case and white space.
    #	new lines are used to indicate the next command
    #	comments begin with # just like python, however they must be on their own line
    #	The current version only checks for some syntax errors
    #   values must be separated by commas
    
    ##commands
    #mov #a, #s, #t      moves #a amount from #s source container number to #t target container
    #temp #s, #v         sets the temperature of #s source to #v value
    #iso #a, #r, #s, #t  isolates #a amount of #r reagent from #s source to #t target
    #pill #s             makes the contents of #s into pills. Identical to mov-ing the contents to 11
    #vial #s             makes the contents of #s into vials. Identical to mov-ing the contents to 12
    #dump #s             dumps the contents of #s. Identical to mov-ing the contents to 13
    #compile             this line anywhere in the code indicates that the resulting program should have ~ appended
    #print #text        prints text (this adds a lot of code to the output)
    
    #loops
    #sfor #i             simple for loop, iterates the code below until end #i times. If #i <= 0 the code is skipped
    #end                 markes the end of a loop
